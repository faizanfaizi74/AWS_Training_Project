**Application Design** - Create a design for the following application:
Tourism is usually the pillar industry of many countries because it has many benefits for improving the national economy and political exchanges. Design a travel-oriented application that provides customized and personalised service. The application should advise and help create a personalized travel itinerary for tourists based on their purpose of visit (exploring, unwind, relaxation, adventure, student trip, business), interests, number of days staying, and financial constraints. The application should essentially help them filter attractions at their potential destination based on personal information entered by them. For example, some tourists may be in Sydney to explore, while others may be there to unwind and relax, while others might prefer a mix of both. Another example is that some tourists might be interested in experiencing Japan's Cherry Blossom season. In this case, the application should suggest the best time to visit Japan to experience this season is in the spring. It should assist them by suggesting the best parks to visit based on their budget and the number of days they are available, or in other words, their available time. Additionally, the application should assist in choosing the best accommodation and all other necessary facilities (such as restaurants and more) by recommending the best ones that fit their budget and were close to the parks.
