## Overview

### Design Problem:
Create a design for the following application:
The Australian property market has undergone “unprecedented growth” in the past two years due to the low-interest rates and strong consumer confidence (Thomas, 2022). This results in significant movements and transactions within the property market that will increase the digital traffic to real websites as more people sell, buy or rent properties. Design an application that allows the property owner and purchaser/tenant to match based on factors detailed below. Property owner will upload their properties for sale or rent on the application. They should also be able to input their desired characteristics of buyers and tenants as criteria (e.g. family size, nationality etc). Purchaser or tenant will then be able to browse for the property based on price, location, proximity to school and transport station.

> This project is the part of Sprint6 which has different design problems. The third day is about designing an application that has the same features as described above.

### End Goal

The end goal of this sprint is to deliver an efficient design that can be used to build the above application.
