## Overview

### Design Problem:

![DesignProblem][]

How would you automate deployment (e-g on AWS) for a system that has:
A) Source code in a repo
B) How do we generate an artifact from the repo that gets published and later is used in some services?
C) Are there more than one solutions?

> This project is the part of Sprint6 which has different design problems. The fifth day is about answering technical questions related to a Codepipeline to automate test, build and deploy processes.

**A) How would you automate deployment (e-g on AWS) for a system that has a source code in a repo**

> The AWS provides the services of GitHub Version 1 and Version 2 that can be used as Source for the auto deplployment of the code on AWS with CodePipeline Service. The user/developer has to to push the code changes in the repo that is connected with CodePipeline to build the artefact for next stages.

**B) How do we generate an artifact from the repo that gets published and later is used in some services?**

> Each pipeline stage can create artifact which are stored in S3 buckets or any other storage service. These are the standarized packeges that are craeted at the output of one stage in accordance for the next stage. The artifact can be generated by fetching the code from repo and synthezing it on build servers. This artifact output code is pushed into codebuild through S3 or any other storage service and used for the next stage.

**C) Are there more than one solutions?**

Yes definatley, A pipeline (source, build, test, deploy stages) can be craeted using many other services such as:

> **Source:** AWS CodeCommit, ECR, S3, BitBucket, GitHub, Any 3rd party Code Repository

> **Build:** AWS CodeBuild, ShellStep, Jenkins CI, CloudBees, TeamCity, Any 3rd party CI Services

> **Deploy:** AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS
