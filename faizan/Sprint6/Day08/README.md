## Design Problem:

> **Application Design ONLY** - Create a design for the following application:
As everyone has been experiencing, there has been an increase in the price of goods and services whether it is because of unstable environmental factors or the state of the current economy. Design an application that will collect and analyze usersâ€™ expenditure data (images of receipts taken from the mobile camera, manually adding expense information ) to present users their personal consumption structure, to manage their everyday finances so that users can deal with their budget and expenses to save money. The application should be able to recognize words and prices from receipts, sort items into specific categories, analyse and calculate the amount of each category at the end of a particular period. The application should also:

> 1.  Remind users of excessed budget and provides expenditure summary
> 2. Create a projection of monthly expenses that the users have
> 3. Provide a goal for users so that they are motivated to manage their daily finances well.

> This project is the part of Sprint6 which has different design problems.
